## Description
This is my first - creation of LLM-based application and public repository.
This Python code extracts food receipe from youtube video using LLM. Transcript text data is parsed through Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-Q4_0-GGUF model (Llama). Llama's response is optmized via prompt engineering and implemtation of GBNF grammars.
